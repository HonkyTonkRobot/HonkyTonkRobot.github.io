Thanks for stopping by my blog repo.

I use this blog as a way to document my development as a software/web developer. 

## About me

I'm just a farm boy who knows how make stuff out of atoms[^1] trying to figure out how to make stuff out of bits. If you would like to read more about my previous career as a furniture maker check out the about page on the blog [Honkytonk Robot - About Page](#)

## Journey Milestones

The Idea of this readme.md is to give you a roadmap for finding the things you'd like to learn about my development journey.
