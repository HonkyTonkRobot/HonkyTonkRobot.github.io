# Thanks for stopping by my blog repo.

I use this blog as a way to document my development as a software/web developer. 

## About me

I'm just a farm boy who knows how to make stuff out of atoms trying to figure out how to make stuff out of bits. If you would like to read more about my previous career as a furniture maker check out the about page on the blog [Honkytonk Robot - About Page](#) _coming soon_

_pictures coming soon_
