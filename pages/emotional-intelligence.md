> Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, understand, and manage oneâ€™s own emotions and relationships. It involves being aware of emotions in oneself and others and using this awareness to guide thinking and behavior. Emotionally intelligent individuals can motivate themselves, read social cues, and build strong relationships[^1]

Essentially, it's important to have EQ to be able to better understand the emotions of others and yourself and how they are effecting the situation you are in. This helps with having more empathy for others and a higher social awareness of how people respond to themselves and others.  
Emotional intelligence is how we react to what life throws at us. Being able to understand that has as an equally important role in our career and relationship successes or failures. 

Something I've personally experience as a leader is my quick action responses, or interruptions have not garnered to trust of those I was meant to lead, causing me to be less successful as a manager, and I believe led internal team combativeness. I am often a git things done kind of person, and I forget to practice kindness.

#### Emotional Awareness and Understanding
- According to this article 95% of people think they are self-aware in reality only about 10-15% are. I find this funny, because I want to say, well I'm self-aware, but maybe I'm just one of those people in the 95%. Reason I think this, is because I know this a weakness of mine, and I have been trying to improve it over the last few years. With some success thanks to books like 'Critical Conversations', 'Never split the difference', and learning about techniques like the Non-confrontational Communication process.

The article goes on to suggest what self-aware people do, and it helps ring true that I'm likely self-aware. The mention attributes like Acknowledging strengths and weaknesses, being open to new data, which is a common thing I say is Strong opinions, loosely held. I am passionate, but am open to learning from other people. Other things the mention is being able to connect your emotions to actions, monitoring one's emotions while recognizing different emotional reactions, and having a fine sense of humor and are confident in themselves and their capabilities. I'd say these are all attributes of who I am, but I know they all need practice, especially the sense of humor part and I find I am often hard on myself, but I infinitely confident in my ability to do.

Tips for improving one's self-awareness:
- Ask for constructive feedback from others
-Keep a journal of ones thoughts and feelings - I've started doing this thanks to Dev Academy and I am really enjoying it thanks to the four Q's
- Practice mindfulness - This is one I have been trying for years, and have never quite achieved a consistent practice, might need to apply my Tiny habits learning.
- pay attention to ones thoughts and feelings, I have a hard time doing this in the moment and again is something I've been trying to do after reading 'Critical Conversations'
- Pursue ones passions - [x]
- Learn new skills and set goals for oneself. [x]
- Reflect on one's Experiences and be grateful. I've recently been implementing this one that to Paul Akers of '2 second lean' and have been seeing positive results
- use positive self-talk daily. Again I got to give thanks to Paul Akers on this one.
- Work on building a growth mindset. I've got this one in spades [x] I feel very fortunate to having such inspiring parents who instilled the cliche "You can do anything you put your mind to" but just watching how they lived their lives, gave me that super-power of believing in my ability to learn anything, and achieve what I want in life. Sometimes I wish I could just follow the "normal" path, but I am glad for the growth mindset I've always had. Though I could improve, I do know that.

#### Emotional Self Regulation
- This is my area of weakness. I am quick to anger, and I am quick to sadness at an easily avoidable mistake. With my drive to achieve I often move a pace that causes lots of mistakes from a lack of mindfulness, but I have been trying diligently to improve these skills, and I think I am making progress, but still have a long way to go. As the article mentions, managing emotions doesn't mean locking them away in a box, but rather finding the right time and tone to express those emotions.

I have found in my own practice the non-confrontation communication process to me extremely helpful for me to communicate hard emotions others make me feel. 

**Pause, Breath, compose oneself, and optionally take time, but ultimately respond** 

Another thing the Simply psychology article says the hits me like a ton of bricks is people proficient in self-regulation tend to be flexible and acclimate well to change. I have a terrible time with change, and it is a thing I am very aware of, but have not yet developed the skills to deal with. In many settings I often have emotional irregularity associated with unexpected changes, that I feel makes me seem childish to my peers. 

Tips for improving one's self-regulation:
- Look at challenge as opportunities. - I definitely do this, even if I'm not happy about it, rising to the challenge is a skill.
- Be mindful of thoughts and feelings - This is where the mindfulness practice would be so useful, but it proved difficult for me.
- build distress and anxiety tolerance skills. - **This is interesting, not sure how to do that. More research....**
- Work on accepting reflections and emotions. - The journalling is proving to be helpful in this area already.
- find ways to manage difficult emotions. - **yep, need help here.**
- Practice communication and social skills - Talking is no problem for me, talking effectively is, I also feel like I over index on my interactions with others, I think in this area, I could actually dial back the analysis of my conversations with people.
- use cognitive re-framing to change emotional responses and thought patterns.
- Recognize that one has a choice in how one responds

This article is really beginning to go on and on. I think I have gained the insight I was looking for.

Understanding the IQ and EQ debate.[^2]

[^2]: [VerywellMind](https://www.verywellmind.com/iq-or-eq-which-one-is-more-important-2795287)

In this article the make reference to a book Emotional Intelligence (putting that on the ~~reading list~~ Listening list) in reference to the author's suggesting that EQ may be a more important determiner of career success that IQ.

So whats the difference? IQ is a number used to express mental ability, and EQ refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.

EQ is a place that I feel I understand, but that emotional regulation is low. I guess the path to improvement is understanding where your weakness lye's.
