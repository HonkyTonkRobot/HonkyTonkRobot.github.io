## What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
I'd like to have my own startup or business making tools for the furniture/woodworking industry. I'm also happy with having a full time Software job and working on open-source furniture/woodworking projects separately.

During this course I am hoping to get enough of a jump start on my knowledge that I can get a job with a supportive team that will help me mature into a proper software developer.

## What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations with be in Bootcamp?
I think my strengths still parrot what I said in sprint 2. I am hardworking, growth minded. I think my limitations are different, through the help of meditation, and time blocking I feel that I am able to stay on task and get things done!

My new weakness is maybe over comparing myself to my classmates and there progress vs my own. I will need to be kind to myself.

## What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be?
I think working with other people. As a motivated person, I will be eager to move at my pace, and the different levels of the class both above and below my own level I can see being a challenge.

## What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
Definitely the ability to give feedback in a way that is received well, and to improve my active listening skills, and not just be so eager for the other person to stop talking so i can talk :sweat_smile:

## What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
I expect them to push my limits and facilitate the reshaping of my brains neural pathways.

## What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
To push my limits and to facilitate the reshaping of my brains neural pathways.

### How are you going to manage your workload?
I've already been keeping a very positive adherence to the schedule posted in my learning plan blog post, but here's a copy to save you a click.

| Daily Schedule |   |
| --- | --- |
| 5am | wake up - coffee/journal/small tasks |
| 7am | Wake the house - breakfast, shower, house admin |
| 8am | Start Dev Academy |
| 12pm | Lunch |
| 5pm | End workday |
|5:30pm | Cook dinner, house admin |
| 7:30pm | Flexible time for study, socializing, or hobbies |
|9:30pm | Evening wind down |
| 10:30pm | Go to bed |

The only update to this plan is instead of having weekends completely off to recharge, I will need to add one more day of study to keep up with the 60hrs expectation that Dev Academy has set.

In preperation for this I've made a plan with my partner to make sure we can achieve this as a family, and that our friends and whƒÅnau can help out over the next 9 weeks while I am diligently studying.
