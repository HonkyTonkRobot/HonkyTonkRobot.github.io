> Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions in ourselves and others. It helps us navigate social situations, build relationships, and respond effectively to challenges[^1].

Having a strong EQ allows me to empathize with others and be more socially aware. I've noticed that my reactions can impact my success as a leader, as my quick responses sometimes undermine trust and create conflict. I often prioritize getting things done over practicing kindness.

#### Emotional Awareness and Understanding
- An article I read states that while 95% of people believe they are self-aware, only 10-15% actually are. I find this amusing because I consider myself self-aware, yet I recognize it as a weakness I'm working to improve. Books like *Crucial Conversations* and *Never Split the Difference* have helped me develop my self-awareness.

Self-aware individuals acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses, remain open to new information, and connect emotions to actions. I resonate with these traits but know they require practice, especially maintaining a sense of humor and being less hard on myself.

**Tips for improving self-awareness:**
- Seek constructive feedback
- Keep a journal of thoughts and feelings
- Practice mindfulness
- Monitor thoughts and feelings
- Pursue passions
- Learn new skills and set goals
- Reflect on experiences and express gratitude
- Use positive self-talk
- Cultivate a growth mindset

#### Emotional Self-Regulation
This is an area where I struggle. I tend to react quickly to anger and sadness, often leading to mistakes due to my fast-paced approach. I've been working on improving my emotional regulation, which involves expressing emotions appropriately rather than suppressing them.

I've found the non-confrontational communication process helpful for addressing difficult emotions.

**Pause, breathe, compose yourself, and respond.**

The article also highlights that those skilled in self-regulation adapt well to change, which is a challenge for me. I often experience emotional irregularity during unexpected changes, making me feel immature.

**Tips for improving self-regulation:**
- View challenges as opportunities
- Be mindful of thoughts and feelings
- Build distress tolerance skills
- Accept and reflect on emotions
- Manage difficult emotions
- Practice effective communication
- Use cognitive reframing
- Recognize the choice in responses

Understanding the IQ and EQ debate.[^2]

[^2]: [VerywellMind](https://www.verywellmind.com/iq-or-eq-which-one-is-more-important-2795287)

The article references the book *Emotional Intelligence*, suggesting that EQ may be a more significant predictor of career success than IQ.

So, what's the difference? IQ measures mental ability, while EQ encompasses the ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. I feel I grasp the concept of EQ, but I recognize my emotional regulation needs improvement. Understanding my weaknesses is the key to improvement.
