## How the sausage is made
Understanding how websites work can feel overwhelming so I'm going to use a simple analogy that does a pretty good job of explaining the different elements like HTML, CSS and how JavaScript interacts with them.

First you have HTML which is like the structure of a house. It's a static structure that has to be built in a certain way. You can customize it sure, but there are rules you have to follow like the "building code". Then you have CSS which is like the paint you choose for the walls, and the furniture in the rooms, and the pictures you have on the wall. This is pretty much the foundation of any website you visit. 

Then comes JavaScript. JavaScript is all of the interactivity in your home. When a light switch is flipped, the lights come on, when the faucet is opened water comes out, and when someone rings your doorbell a sound is made. JavaScript is the ability to manipulate the HTML and CSS. If you can imagine with me for a moment, if you just command your furniture to switch to a particular layout when you push a button, and have the walls change color at the same time, oh and have the radio turn on to your favorite playlist.That's what JavaScript is able to do with HTML and CSS. It can completely transform them in an instance. 

## How JavaScript works
In JavaScript there are all kinds of concepts that make different things happen to a webpage. A couple of examples of these are control flow and loops.

- **control flow** is like putting a condition on what action to perform. You can think of this kind of like a traffic light. If the light is red stop, if yellow prepare to stop, otherwise keep driving. Here's an example of what it looks like in JavaScript.

```
let kidsAge = 16
if(age < 18) {
  console.log("No entry to the bar")
else
  console.log("let them into the bar")
```
In this example the condition of `age < 18` controls the flow of who gets into the bar, and who does not get let into the bar.

- **Loops** are another example of a JavaScript concept. You can think
