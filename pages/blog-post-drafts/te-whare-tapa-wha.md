## What is Te Whare Tapa Whā?
Te Whare Tapa Whā translates in to English as the four walls of the house. Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Maori perspective on health developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984. It represents the 4 dimensions of wellbeing.

- Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)
- Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing)
- Taha wairua (spirictual wellbeing)
- Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)

The final element of the Te Whare Tapa Whā, is the wharenui's (big house's) connection to whenua (land, sea, natural world). This is the foundation for the four dimensions of wellbeing.
