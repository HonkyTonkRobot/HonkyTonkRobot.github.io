## A Time I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem
### What Was the Problem?
In the 'Gradebook Kata' exercise, I struggled with problem 3 despite trying various approaches.

### What Problem-Solving Techniques Did You Use?
I experimented with `for in` loops, `for` loops, and combinations of both, overcomplicating the solution. Ultimately, I realized the answer was simply using the `.forEach()` method, which I had learned previously, but with added value and index parameters.

### How Did You Feel Throughout the Process?
I felt frustrated but persisted because I wanted to learn. I researched various techniques but now see that using pseudocode could have clarified my thinking.

### What Did You Learn?
I learned that overcoming challenging problems deepens my understanding and memory of techniques. Specifically, I discovered that the `.forEach()` method can utilize an array's index similarly to a traditional for loop.

## A Time I Was Able to Elegantly Solve a Problem
### What Was the Problem?
In the 'flipflop Kata,' I needed to determine if an array of numbers was divisible by 5, 3, or both.

### What Problem-Solving Techniques Did You Use?
I primarily used pseudocode, recognizing that the solution would involve an if-else structure based on our previous work with conditionals.

### How Did You Feel Throughout the Process?
I felt confident and on the right track. Although it took several attempts, I was assured that persistence would lead to a solution.

### What Did You Learn?
I learned that in an if-else statement, I can assign the result to a variable and return it outside the statement. This approach, which I discovered through research, proved effective.

## Reflect on Confidence in Problem-Solving Techniques
- Pseudocode: 7/10
- Trying Something: 7/10
- Rubber Ducky Method: 4/10
- Reading Error Messages: 6/10
- Googling: 8/10
- Asking Peers for Help: 7/10
- Asking Coaches for Help: 4/10
- Improving Process with Reflection: 10/10

Reflection is my strongest skill, helping me solidify and recall what I learn.

## Reflect on Reluctance to Ask for Help
I hesitated to ask for help on the 'Gradebook Kata' after recently seeking assistance and feeling more stuck. I noticed that others weren't asking for help as frequently, which made me feel isolated in my struggles. I messaged my facilitator but received no response, leading me to continue working on the problem alone until I eventually found a solution.

This exercise was particularly challenging, and I felt even more hopeless with the next problem. I spent the entire 4.5 hours allotted before giving up, realizing I should have used pseudocode. My reluctance to reach out stemmed from embarrassment, which is unusual for me.

Next time, I will diligently apply each problem-solving technique and carefully review the provided information, as I found that some hints made a problem much easier to solve.
