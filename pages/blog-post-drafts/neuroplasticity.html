<h2 id="your-brain---reflections">Your Brain - Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Taken from Dev Academy pre-course work dev-journal-day-1</em> In
this prep exercise the goal was to understand how knowing about
neuroplasticty of the brain can help us become better learners.
Neuropliasticity is basically your brains ability to reshape itself
depending on how you are using your brain. This can help people
understand that they can grow their brains and that it’s not a fixed
thing from birth.</p>
<p>What I found interesting is engaging this concept we can facilitate
the neuroplasticity of our brains by confronting what we don’t know, and
being curious about learning new things. A few ways that we can
influence this is by actively trying to learn something new not unlike
this Dev Academy course. Physical exercise and mindfulness are some
other things that can help facilitate this brain growth/restructuring
that is always happening.</p>
<p>One of the examples used was describing the neural networks like
highways connecting different cities. The highways with the most traffic
would get wider and bigger, and the ones with the least traffic would be
smaller, and if something changed and one path started getting more
traffic, the neural network would adjust the sizes to match. Therefore
the more we focus on a certain thing the stronger those pathways
get.</p>
<p>Another concept mentioned is the idea of a growth mindset. This is
something I have always thought about myself, because I love learning
and have always been curious. From what I understand about a growth
mindset is being open to challenge and not being afraid of failure,
knowing it is on the road to success will help you more easily adapt to
a growth mindset.</p>

<p>Way’s I will incorporate this into my learning plan, include using
spaced repetition facilitated by <a
