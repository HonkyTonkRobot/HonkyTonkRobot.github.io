### Past
I grew up on a farm in Mississippi, I studied Industrial and Service Designer at University and have been working in furniture design and manufacturing ever since. Early in my career I used computers to achieve the work I was doing, from 3d modeling, to programming CNC machines. I even built my own CNC machine once, which looking back I would not do again, but I did learn a lot.

### Present
As I've gone through my career I have always seen opportunities for improving how I do the work I do through software, but didn't think I had the means to do it myself either financially (hire someone) or build it myself, So I've always defaulted to what I can do with no code, or paper solutions. In my last role as a production manager I had the opportunity to implement some design to manufacturing automation software, and through that had to learn a little bit of XML and SQL, and I feel like a light bulb went off. I could be a software developer! I know I learned some real basic stuff, but what it showed me is that I can understand how to build software.
