## 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?

-  My long term goal is to be able to build software that changes the industry I come from the woodworking industry. I see ways I can improve upon the tools available to the woodworking market, and am keen to acquire the skills to be able to make those tools. Though for now my medium term goals are to get into a tech company where I can start improving my skills as a software developer.

## 2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
- strengths: I am hardworking, and dedicated. I will put in the time to learn something. Also, I've got a growth mindset and always curious to find ways to improve both new and old skills and processes. 
- limitations: I can go down rabbit holes, and find myself on the back foot in regards to getting my work done in a timely manner. I am time constrained, as I have a family, so I must find a way to be efficient. ( I doing my best to follow the time blocking set forward by EDA to help me stay on course. So far it has been really great ) 
- I have a short attention span in lecturing so I stoked for the flipped class room, as I am disciplined enough to do the work, but have a hard time with classroom lectures. I can only watch youtube at 2x speed not because I am in hurry, but because it engages my brain in a way that I can pay attention. (my brain doesn't have time to wander)
- I can start to get stressed and overwhelmed when I am falling behind, and it is important to me that I create the environment for productivity. This includes both my personal space and timely communication with classmates and facilitators.

## 3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
- ability to navigate team conflict, while still defending my point of view, but being flexible enough to change that point of view, with the presentation of new information. "Strong opinions, loosely held"
- Building repor in the workplace. As a worker I am often head down get shit done kind of person, but I believe this no small talk, silo'd way of working effects my ability to form strong working relationships with my co-workers.
- Communicating early. When I have an idea, having conversations early, to learn the teams perspectives on the idea. That way when I present the idea, I can speak to the ideas, concerns my colleagues had. This also goes the other way communicating early when there is a problem or a possible problem. The soon more perspectives can be added to a potential problem the sooner it can be solved or maybe even before the problem arrives.
- Time management - I am loving the time blocking, but am unsure how to setup reasonable time blocking for things when I don't know how long it should take.

## 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
- An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Faciliators and industry/community representatives

####    Personally:
- I plan to manage my work load through commitment to time blocking. I can see how this will make my time management stronger.
- Journaling - by do the Four Q's I learned in the pre-course work, I think this will help my work stick, and help me stay accountable to my learning goals, as I will have to think about what I am doing. So far I have been able to keep the journal alive, by attaching it as a new habit to my morning coffee routine, and evening bedtime snack routine.

####    Team setting:
- Treating people with respect, and listening to what they have to say.
- Being flexible to the wants/needs of other team members, but also calmly engaging in discourse.
- Holding myself and others accountable for what they say will do.
  - Using strategies like like, starting with questions to gain understanding and context.
  - And the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process. It's four parts include, a specific observation, the underlying feeling, a need, and a request.
- Early communication, just like I said in Q3 about an area I would personally like to improve, is not letting it get to the point that I am angry, and addressing problems I see before they are at a tipping point.

#### Facilitators
- To continue on conflict resolution, escalating a problem when it seems there is a deadlock, to hopefully help by providing opinion or mediation. Important part of this process for me is discussing with the person or persons in conflict that I would like to escalate the conversation to a facilitator and reaching out together.
- I want facilitators to be available for questions and helping me work through problems I am having in my course work. For me to be able to stay on track with the time blocking exercises I need them to be active in the chats where we are discussing roadblocks.
        
### What you will do when things 
- Are tense between group project team members.
  - Answered above, but ask questions get to the heart of the problem, and use the NVC process to communicate how the actions of others are effecting me.
- Are behind schedule
  - Take a deep breath, and make a list of what still needs to be done, how much time is left, and figure out how to 80/20 it, so I can at least deliver the course requirements, in the allotted time.

## 5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
As we've already discussed with Joseph our fundamentals facilitator, reaching out for help after 20min of being stuck. Giving myself enough time to try and solve the problem, but not so long I become dishearted, especially because I've got to make my time management count. Reaching out to the whole group both classmates and facilitators through the discord.
## 6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

- I want them to be available during standard business hours (9am-5pm). 
- I expect them to be more knowledgeable than I am at the work they are asking of me, so that they can help me get through challenges. 
- I expect them to mediate problems between group members on group projects. 
- I expect them to gently nudge us when it seems we are off track.

## 7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. it's important to plan these in.
- I have a pretty strict routine that allows me to get work done effectively
   `5am` wake up - coffee/Journal/small TODO's
   `7am` wake the house up - Make breakfast, shower, house admin
   `8am` start dev academy
   - flexible lunch block, but typically take 30-60min depending on if I need to run any errands.
   `5pm` End the work day
   `530pm` Start cooking dinner, house admin
   `730pm` flexible block of time for extra study, afterwork hangouts, or hobbies.
   `930pm` Evening wind down
   `1030pm` Go to bed.
- Weekends off, focus on family, friends, housework, hobbies, etc.
- I have been on the routine for some time, even before EDA and find that when I stray from it life becomes difficult, This is the balance that really works well for me both from a work/family.
