## 1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?

- My long-term goal is to develop software that transforms the woodworking industry by improving existing tools. In the medium term, I aim to join a tech company to enhance my skills as a software developer.

## 2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning

- **Strengths:** I am hardworking, dedicated, and possess a growth mindset. I am always eager to improve my skills and processes.
- **Limitations:** I tend to get sidetracked, which can hinder timely completion of tasks. Balancing family commitments makes efficiency crucial. I struggle with traditional lectures but thrive in flipped classrooms, often needing to watch videos at 2x speed to maintain focus. I can feel stressed when falling behind, so I prioritize creating a productive environment and maintaining clear communication with peers and facilitators.

## 3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

- Navigating team conflict while being open to new perspectives.
- Building rapport with colleagues, moving beyond a siloed work approach.
- Communicating ideas and concerns early to foster collaboration and problem-solving.
- Improving time management through effective time blocking.

## 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

- **Personally:** I will commit to time blocking to enhance my time management and use journaling (the Four Q's) to stay accountable and reflective about my learning.

- **Team Setting:** I will treat others with respect, remain flexible, and engage in constructive discussions. I will hold myself and others accountable, using strategies like asking questions for understanding and applying Nonviolent Communication (NVC). I will address issues early to prevent escalation.

- **Facilitators:** I will escalate conflicts when necessary and seek their guidance on coursework challenges, ensuring they are active in discussions about roadblocks.

### What you will do when things

- **Are tense between group project team members:** I will ask questions to identify the root of the problem and use the NVC process to express my feelings.

- **Are behind schedule:** I will take a deep breath, list remaining tasks, and prioritize effectively to meet course requirements.

## 5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

I will reach out for help after 20 minutes of being stuck, allowing enough time to attempt a solution without becoming discouraged. I will communicate with classmates and facilitators via Discord.

## 6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

- I expect them to be available during standard business hours (9am-5pm) and to possess greater knowledge than I do to help me overcome challenges. I also expect them to mediate group project issues and provide gentle guidance when we stray off track.

## 7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.

I follow a strict routine for effective work-life balance:
- `5am`: Wake up - coffee/journal/small tasks
- `7am`: Wake the house - breakfast, shower, house admin
- `8am`: Start Dev Academy
- Flexible lunch block (30-60 min)
- `5pm`: End workday
- `5:30pm`: Cook dinner, house admin
- `7:30pm`: Flexible time for study, socializing, or hobbies
- `9:30pm`: Evening wind down
- `10:30pm`: Go to bed
- Weekends are reserved for family, friends, and hobbies. This routine has proven effective for maintaining balance in my work and family life.
