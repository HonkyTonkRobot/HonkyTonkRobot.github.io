      <h2 id="what-is-your-long-term-goal-or-career-pathway">1.
        What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>My long-term goal is to develop software that transforms
          the woodworking industry by improving existing tools. In the
          medium term, I aim to join a tech company to enhance my
          skills as a software developer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-description-of-your-strengths-and-limitations-when-it-comes-to-learning">2.
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it
        comes to learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> I am hardworking, dedicated,
          and possess a growth mindset. I am always eager to improve
          my skills and processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> I tend to get sidetracked,
          which can hinder timely completion of tasks. Balancing
          family commitments makes efficiency crucial. I struggle with
          traditional lectures but thrive in flipped classrooms, often
          needing to watch videos at 2x speed to maintain focus. I can
          feel stressed when falling behind, so I prioritize creating
          a productive environment and maintaining clear communication
          with peers and facilitators.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="what-skills-non-technicalhuman-skills-would-you-like-to-see-developed-in-yourself-while-at-dev-academy">3.
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to
        see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigating team conflict while being open to new
          perspectives.</li>
        <li>Building rapport with colleagues, moving beyond a siloed
          work approach.</li>
        <li>Communicating ideas and concerns early to foster
          collaboration and problem-solving.</li>
        <li>Improving time management through effective time
          blocking.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-commitment-to-how-you-will-manage-your-workload-in-this-programme.-this-should-include">4.
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
        programme. This should include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Personally:</strong> I will commit to time
            blocking to enhance my time management and use journaling
            (the Four Q’s) to stay accountable and reflective about my
            learning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Team Setting:</strong> I will treat others
            with respect, remain flexible, and engage in constructive
            discussions. I will hold myself and others accountable,
            using strategies like asking questions for understanding and
            applying Nonviolent Communication (NVC). I will address
            issues early to prevent escalation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Facilitators:</strong> I will escalate
            conflicts when necessary and seek their guidance on
            coursework challenges, ensuring they are active in
            discussions about roadblocks.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="what-you-will-do-when-things">What you will do when
        things</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Are tense between group project team
              members:</strong> I will ask questions to identify the root
            of the problem and use the NVC process to express my
            feelings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Are behind schedule:</strong> I will take a
            deep breath, list remaining tasks, and prioritize
            effectively to meet course requirements.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-commitment-as-to-how-and-where-you-will-seek-help-in-a-timely-way">5.
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a
        timely way</h2>
      <p>I will reach out for help after 20 minutes of being
        stuck, allowing enough time to attempt a solution without
        becoming discouraged. I will communicate with classmates and
        facilitators via Discord.</p>
      <h2 id="a-description-of-what-you-expect-from-the-facilitation-team">6.
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation
        team</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I expect them to be available during standard business
          hours (9am-5pm) and to possess greater knowledge than I do
          to help me overcome challenges. I also expect them to
          mediate group project issues and provide gentle guidance
          when we stray off track.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="any-scheduling-information-such-as-block-out-times-when-you-are-committed-to-other-things.">7.
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
        are committed to other things.</h2>
      <p>I follow a strict routine for effective work-life
        balance: - <code>5am</code>: Wake up - coffee/journal/small
        tasks - <code>7am</code>: Wake the house - breakfast,
        shower, house admin - <code>8am</code>: Start Dev Academy -
        Flexible lunch block (30-60 min) - <code>5pm</code>: End
        workday - <code>5:30pm</code>: Cook dinner, house admin -
        <code>7:30pm</code>: Flexible time for study, socializing,
        or hobbies - <code>9:30pm</code>: Evening wind down -
        <code>10:30pm</code>: Go to bed - Weekends are reserved for
        family, friends, and hobbies. This routine has proven
        effective for maintaining balance in my work and family
        life.
