      <h2 id="what-is-your-long-term-goal-or-career-pathway">1. What is your
        long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>My long term goal is to be able to build software that changes the
          industry I come from the woodworking industry. I see ways I can improve
          upon the tools available to the woodworking market, and am keen to
          acquire the skills to be able to make those tools. Though for now my
          medium term goals are to get into a tech company where I can start
          improving my skills as a software developer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-description-of-your-strengths-and-limitations-when-it-comes-to-learning">2.
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>strengths: I am hardworking, and dedicated. I will put in the time
          to learn something. Also, I’ve got a growth mindset and always curious
          to find ways to improve both new and old skills and processes.</li>
        <li>limitations: I can go down rabbit holes, and find myself on the back
          foot in regards to getting my work done in a timely manner. I am time
          constrained, as I have a family, so I must find a way to be efficient. (
          I doing my best to follow the time blocking set forward by EDA to help
          me stay on course. So far it has been really great )</li>
        <li>I have a short attention span in lecturing so I stoked for the
          flipped class room, as I am disciplined enough to do the work, but have
          a hard time with classroom lectures. I can only watch youtube at 2x
          speed not because I am in hurry, but because it engages my brain in a
          way that I can pay attention. (my brain doesn’t have time to
          wander)</li>
        <li>I can start to get stressed and overwhelmed when I am falling
          behind, and it is important to me that I create the environment for
          productivity. This includes both my personal space and timely
          communication with classmates and facilitators.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="what-skills-non-technicalhuman-skills-would-you-like-to-see-developed-in-yourself-while-at-dev-academy">3.
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>ability to navigate team conflict, while still defending my point of
          view, but being flexible enough to change that point of view, with the
          presentation of new information. “Strong opinions, loosely held”</li>
        <li>Building repor in the workplace. As a worker I am often head down
          get shit done kind of person, but I believe this no small talk, silo’d
          way of working effects my ability to form strong working relationships
          with my co-workers.</li>
        <li>Communicating early. When I have an idea, having conversations
          early, to learn the teams perspectives on the idea. That way when I
          present the idea, I can speak to the ideas, concerns my colleagues had.
          This also goes the other way communicating early when there is a problem
          or a possible problem. The soon more perspectives can be added to a
          potential problem the sooner it can be solved or maybe even before the
          problem arrives.</li>
        <li>Time management - I am loving the time blocking, but am unsure how
          to setup reasonable time blocking for things when I don’t know how long
          it should take.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-commitment-to-how-you-will-manage-your-workload-in-this-programme.-this-should-include">4.
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Faciliators and industry/community
          representatives</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="personally">Personally:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I plan to manage my work load through commitment to time blocking. I
          can see how this will make my time management stronger.</li>
        <li>Journaling - by do the Four Q’s I learned in the pre-course work, I
          think this will help my work stick, and help me stay accountable to my
          learning goals, as I will have to think about what I am doing. So far I
          have been able to keep the journal alive, by attaching it as a new habit
          to my morning coffee routine, and evening bedtime snack routine.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="team-setting">Team setting:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Treating people with respect, and listening to what they have to
          say.</li>
        <li>Being flexible to the wants/needs of other team members, but also
          calmly engaging in discourse.</li>
        <li>Holding myself and others accountable for what they say will do.
          <ul>
            <li>Using strategies like like, starting with questions to gain
              understanding and context.</li>
            <li>And the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process. It’s four parts
              include, a specific observation, the underlying feeling, a need, and a
              request.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Early communication, just like I said in Q3 about an area I would
          personally like to improve, is not letting it get to the point that I am
          angry, and addressing problems I see before they are at a tipping
          point.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="facilitators">Facilitators</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To continue on conflict resolution, escalating a problem when it
          seems there is a deadlock, to hopefully help by providing opinion or
          mediation. Important part of this process for me is discussing with the
          person or persons in conflict that I would like to escalate the
          conversation to a facilitator and reaching out together.</li>
        <li>I want facilitators to be available for questions and helping me
          work through problems I am having in my course work. For me to be able
          to stay on track with the time blocking exercises I need them to be
          active in the chats where we are discussing roadblocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="what-you-will-do-when-things">What you will do when things</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Are tense between group project team members.
          <ul>
            <li>Answered above, but ask questions get to the heart of the problem,
              and use the NVC process to communicate how the actions of others are
              effecting me.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Are behind schedule
          <ul>
            <li>Take a deep breath, and make a list of what still needs to be done,
              how much time is left, and figure out how to 80/20 it, so I can at least
              deliver the course requirements, in the allotted time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="a-commitment-as-to-how-and-where-you-will-seek-help-in-a-timely-way">5.
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>As we’ve already discussed with Joseph our fundamentals facilitator,
        reaching out for help after 20min of being stuck. Giving myself enough
        time to try and solve the problem, but not so long I become dishearted,
        especially because I’ve got to make my time management count. Reaching
        out to the whole group both classmates and facilitators through the
        discord. ## 6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation
        team</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I want them to be available during standard business hours
          (9am-5pm).</li>
        <li>I expect them to be more knowledgeable than I am at the work they
          are asking of me, so that they can help me get through challenges.</li>
        <li>I expect them to mediate problems between group members on group
          projects.</li>
        <li>I expect them to gently nudge us when it seems we are off
          track.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2
        id="any-scheduling-information-such-as-block-out-times-when-you-are-committed-to-other-things.-for-example-you-might-have-whanau-commitments-like-school-drop-offs.-its-important-to-plan-these-in.">
        7.
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau
        commitments like school drop-offs. it’s important to plan these in.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have a pretty strict routine that allows me to get work done
          effectively <code>5am</code> wake up - coffee/Journal/small TODO’s
          <code>7am</code> wake the house up - Make breakfast, shower, house admin
          <code>8am</code> start dev academy
          <ul>
            <li>flexible lunch block, but typically take 30-60min depending on if I
              need to run any errands. <code>5pm</code> End the work day
              <code>530pm</code> Start cooking dinner, house admin <code>730pm</code>
              flexible block of time for extra study, afterwork hangouts, or hobbies.
              <code>930pm</code> Evening wind down <code>1030pm</code> Go to bed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Weekends off, focus on family, friends, housework, hobbies,
          etc.</li>
        <li>I have been on the routine for some time, even before EDA and find
          that when I stray from it life becomes difficult, This is the balance
          that really works well for me both from a work/family.</li>
