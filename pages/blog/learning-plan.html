        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>DevAcademy Human Skills Learning Plan</p>
        <p></p>
      </hgroup>

      <h2 id="what-is-your-long-term-goal-andor-career-pathway">What
        is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>I’d like to have my own startup or business making tools
        for the furniture/woodworking industry. I’m also happy with
        having a full time Software job and working on open-source
        furniture/woodworking projects separately.</p>
      <p>During this course I am hoping to get enough of a jump
        start on my knowledge that I can get a job with a supportive
        team that will help me mature into a proper software
        developer.</p>
      <h2 id="what-do-you-think-your-biggest-strengths-and-limitations-with-be-in-bootcamp">What
        do you think your biggest strengths and limitations with be
        in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>I think my strengths still parrot what I said in sprint
        2. I am hardworking, growth minded. I think my limitations
        are different, through the help of meditation, and time
        blocking I feel that I am able to stay on task and get
        things done!</p>
      <p>My new weakness is maybe over comparing myself to my
        classmates and there progress vs my own. I will need to be
        kind to myself.</p>
      <h2 id="what-do-you-think-your-biggest-non-technical-challenge-at-bootcamp-will-be">What
        do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
        bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <p>I think working with other people. As a motivated person,
        I will be eager to move at my pace, and the different levels
        of the class both above and below my own level I can see
        being a challenge.</p>
      <h2
        id="what-non-technical-skills---human-skills---would-you-like-to-see-developed-in-yourself-while-at-dev-academy">
        What
        non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>Definitely the ability to give feedback in a way that is
        received well, and to improve my active listening skills,
        and not just be so eager for the other person to stop
        talking so i can talk :sweat_smile:</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-your-expectations-from-the-bootcamp-team">What
        are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>I expect them to push my limits and facilitate the
        reshaping of my brains neural pathways.</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-your-expectations-of-yourself-on-bootcamp">What
        are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>To push my limits and to facilitate the reshaping of my
        brains neural pathways.</p>
      <h3 id="how-are-you-going-to-manage-your-workload">How are
        you going to manage your workload?</h3>
      <p>I’ve already been keeping a very positive adherence to
        the schedule posted in my learning plan blog post, but
        here’s a copy to save you a click.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Daily Schedule</th>
            <th></th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>5am</td>
            <td>wake up - coffee/journal/small tasks</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>7am</td>
            <td>Wake the house - breakfast, shower, house admin</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>8am</td>
            <td>Start Dev Academy</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>12pm</td>
            <td>Lunch</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5pm</td>
            <td>End workday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5:30pm</td>
            <td>Cook dinner, house admin</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>7:30pm</td>
            <td>Flexible time for study, socializing, or hobbies</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>9:30pm</td>
            <td>Evening wind down</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>10:30pm</td>
            <td>Go to bed</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The only update to this plan is instead of having
        weekends completely off to recharge, I will need to add one
        more day of study to keep up with the 60hrs expectation that
        Dev Academy has set.</p>
      <p>In preperation for this I’ve made a plan with my partner
        to make sure we can achieve this as a family, and that our
        friends and whānau can help out over the next 9 weeks while
        I am diligently studying.</p>
