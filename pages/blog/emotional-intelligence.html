        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>This Sprint 3 - Human Skills blog post is my research into EQ and why it’s important as a web developer to
          refine emotional intelligence alongside programming and computer science skills.</p>
        <p>2025-01-20</p>
      </hgroup>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to perceive,
          understand, and manage emotions in ourselves and others. It
          helps us navigate social situations, build relationships,
          and respond effectively to challenges[^1]. [^1]: <a
            href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/emotional-intelligence.html">Simply
            Psychology</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Having a strong EQ allows me to empathize with others and
        be more socially aware. I’ve noticed that my reactions can
        impact my success as a leader, as my quick responses
        sometimes undermine trust and create conflict. I often
        prioritize getting things done over practicing kindness.</p>
      <h4 id="emotional-awareness-and-understanding">Emotional
        Awareness and Understanding</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>An article I read states that while 95% of people
          believe they are self-aware, only 10-15% actually are. I
          find this amusing because I consider myself self-aware, yet
          I recognize it as a weakness I’m working to improve. Books
          like <em>Crucial Conversations</em> and <em>Never Split the
            Difference</em> have helped me develop my
          self-awareness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Self-aware individuals acknowledge their strengths and
        weaknesses, remain open to new information, and connect
        emotions to actions. I resonate with these traits but know
        they require practice, especially maintaining a sense of
        humor and being less hard on myself.</p>
      <p><strong>Tips for improving self-awareness:</strong> -
        Seek constructive feedback - Keep a journal of thoughts and
        feelings - Practice mindfulness - Monitor thoughts and
        feelings - Pursue passions - Learn new skills and set goals
        - Reflect on experiences and express gratitude - Use
        positive self-talk - Cultivate a growth mindset</p>
      <h4 id="emotional-self-regulation">Emotional
        Self-Regulation</h4>
      <p>This is an area where I struggle. I tend to react quickly
        to anger and sadness, often leading to mistakes due to my
        fast-paced approach. I’ve been working on improving my
        emotional regulation, which involves expressing emotions
        appropriately rather than suppressing them.</p>
      <p>I’ve found the non-confrontational communication process
        helpful for addressing difficult emotions.</p>
      <p><strong>Pause, breathe, compose yourself, and
          respond.</strong></p>
      <p>The article also highlights that those skilled in
        self-regulation adapt well to change, which is a challenge
        for me. I often experience emotional irregularity during
        unexpected changes, making me feel immature.</p>
      <p><strong>Tips for improving self-regulation:</strong> -
        View challenges as opportunities - Be mindful of thoughts
        and feelings - Build distress tolerance skills - Accept and
        reflect on emotions - Manage difficult emotions - Practice
        effective communication - Use cognitive reframing -
        Recognize the choice in responses</p>
      <p>This article has provided valuable insights.</p>

      <p>Understanding the IQ and EQ debate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
      <p>The article references the book <em>Emotional
          Intelligence</em>, suggesting that EQ may be a more
        significant predictor of career success than IQ.</p>
      <p>So, what’s the difference? IQ measures mental ability,
        while EQ encompasses the ability to perceive, control,
        evaluate, and express emotions. I feel I grasp the concept
        of EQ, but I recognize my emotional regulation needs
        improvement. Understanding my weaknesses is the key to
        improvement.</p>
