<p>Title: “Emotional Intelligence” Author: “Joel Anderson” Date:
“2024-01-20” Descrption: “This Sprint 3 - Human Skills blog post is my
research into EQ why it’s important as a web developer to refine your
emotional intelligence along side your programming and computer science
skills.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, understand,
and manage one’s own emotions and relationships. It involves being aware
of emotions in oneself and others and using this awareness to guide
thinking and behavior. Emotionally intelligent individuals can motivate
themselves, read social cues, and build strong relationships[^1] [^1]:
<a
href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/emotional-intelligence.html">Simply
Psychology</a> Essentially, it’s important to have EQ to be able to
better understand the emotions of others and yourself and how they are
effecting the situation you are in. This helps with having more empathy
for others and a higher social awareness of how people respond to
themselves and others.<br />
Emotional intelligence is how we react to what life throws at us. Being
able to understand that has as an equally important role in our career
and relationship successes or failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something I’ve personally experience as a leader is my quick action
responses, or interruptions have not garnered to trust of those I was
meant to lead, causing me to be less successful as a manager, and I
believe led internal team combativeness. I am often a git things done
kind of person, and I forget to practice kindness.</p>
<h4 id="emotional-awareness-and-understanding">Emotional Awareness and
Understanding</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to this article 95% of people think they are self-aware in
reality only about 10-15% are. I find this funny, because I want to say,
well I’m self-aware, but maybe I’m just one of those people in the 95%.
Reason I think this, is because I know this a weakness of mine, and I
have been trying to improve it over the last few years. With some
success thanks to books like ‘Critical Conversations’, ‘Never split the
difference’, and learning about techniques like the Non-confrontational
Communication process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article goes on to suggest what self-aware people do, and it
helps ring true that I’m likely self-aware. The mention attributes like
Acknowledging strengths and weaknesses, being open to new data, which is
a common thing I say is Strong opinions, loosely held. I am passionate,
but am open to learning from other people. Other things the mention is
being able to connect your emotions to actions, monitoring one’s
emotions while recognizing different emotional reactions, and having a
fine sense of humor and are confident in themselves and their
capabilities. I’d say these are all attributes of who I am, but I know
they all need practice, especially the sense of humor part and I find I
am often hard on myself, but I infinitely confident in my ability to
do.</p>
<p>Tips for improving one’s self-awareness: - Ask for constructive
feedback from others -Keep a journal of ones thoughts and feelings -
I’ve started doing this thanks to Dev Academy and I am really enjoying
it thanks to the four Q’s - Practice mindfulness - This is one I have
been trying for years, and have never quite achieved a consistent
practice, might need to apply my Tiny habits learning. - pay attention
to ones thoughts and feelings, I have a hard time doing this in the
moment and again is something I’ve been trying to do after reading
‘Critical Conversations’ - Pursue ones passions - [x] - Learn new skills
and set goals for oneself. [x] - Reflect on one’s Experiences and be
grateful. I’ve recently been implementing this one that to Paul Akers of
‘2 second lean’ and have been seeing positive results - use positive
self-talk daily. Again I got to give thanks to Paul Akers on this one. -
Work on building a growth mindset. I’ve got this one in spades [x] I
feel very fortunate to having such inspiring parents who instilled the
cliche “You can do anything you put your mind to” but just watching how
they lived their lives, gave me that super-power of believing in my
ability to learn anything, and achieve what I want in life. Sometimes I
wish I could just follow the “normal” path, but I am glad for the growth
mindset I’ve always had. Though I could improve, I do know that.</p>
<h4 id="emotional-self-regulation">Emotional Self Regulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is my area of weakness. I am quick to anger, and I am quick to
sadness at an easily avoidable mistake. With my drive to achieve I often
move a pace that causes lots of mistakes from a lack of mindfulness, but
I have been trying diligently to improve these skills, and I think I am
making progress, but still have a long way to go. As the article
mentions, managing emotions doesn’t mean locking them away in a box, but
rather finding the right time and tone to express those emotions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found in my own practice the non-confrontation communication
process to me extremely helpful for me to communicate hard emotions
others make me feel.</p>
<p><strong>Pause, Breath, compose oneself, and optionally take time, but
ultimately respond</strong></p>
<p>Another thing the Simply psychology article says the hits me like a
ton of bricks is people proficient in self-regulation tend to be
flexible and acclimate well to change. I have a terrible time with
change, and it is a thing I am very aware of, but have not yet developed
the skills to deal with. In many settings I often have emotional
irregularity associated with unexpected changes, that I feel makes me
seem childish to my peers.</p>
<p>Tips for improving one’s self-regulation: - Look at challenge as
opportunities. - I definitely do this, even if I’m not happy about it,
rising to the challenge is a skill. - Be mindful of thoughts and
feelings - This is where the mindfulness practice would be so useful,
but it proved difficult for me. - build distress and anxiety tolerance
skills. - <strong>This is interesting, not sure how to do that. More
research….</strong> - Work on accepting reflections and emotions. - The
journalling is proving to be helpful in this area already. - find ways
to manage difficult emotions. - <strong>yep, need help here.</strong> -
Practice communication and social skills - Talking is no problem for me,
talking effectively is, I also feel like I over index on my interactions
with others, I think in this area, I could actually dial back the
analysis of my conversations with people. - use cognitive re-framing to
change emotional responses and thought patterns. - Recognize that one
has a choice in how one responds</p>
<p>This article is really beginning to go on and on. I think I have
gained the insight I was looking for.</p>
<hr />
<p>Understanding the IQ and EQ debate.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In this article the make reference to a book Emotional Intelligence
(putting that on the <del>reading list</del> Listening list) in
reference to the author’s suggesting that EQ may be a more important
determiner of career success that IQ.</p>
<p>So whats the difference? IQ is a number used to express mental
ability, and EQ refers to a person’s ability to perceive, control,
evaluate, and express emotions.</p>
<p>EQ is a place that I feel I understand, but that emotional regulation
is low. I guess the path to improvement is understanding where your
weakness lye’s.</p>
