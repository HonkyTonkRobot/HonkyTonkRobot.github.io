      <h2 id="what-surprised-me-the-most-about-the-human-skills-learning-is">What
        surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning
        is…</h2>
      <p>That things I’ve been trying to improve in my personal
        life over the last two years were being parroted in these
        learnings. It felt good to recognize that what I had
        identified in myself as an area for growth, was also what
        Dev Academy thinks it’s students need.</p>
      <p>What was even better is although I recognized the need
        for growth, my attempts at growth were scatter shot. I was
        doing research and making guesses about how to improve those
        skills, where the provided training, and especially the
        pre-course curriculum, I have been really pleased with.</p>
      <p>I’ve been able to consistently adopt tiny habits thinking
        in sereral areas of life that previous attempts would only
        last for a few weeks at a time, until I had a renewed
        motivation spike. Also, time blocking is amazing, though I
        <del>HATE</del> <strong>strongly dislike</strong> Toggl.com
        I liked how keeping track of the time is helping me complete
        tasks, and not get lost in the details.
      </p>
      <p>The most invaluable thing for me has been journalling,
        and meditation. These two things together have helped me
        keep a clear mind even when week 4 was testing me. I will
        say it’s an ebb and flow, but I almost daily do the four Q’s
        in a personal journal and find trying to recall what i
        learned that day as a good test of if I actually learned it,
        and if I haven’t but if can I still remember what the thing
        is called I’ll just have a quick refresh on MDN or Geek for
        Geek to help solidify what i learned.</p>
      <p>I’ve also taken up the use of AnkiWeb.net, which is not
        explicitly recommended by Dev Academy, but I found it thanks
        to there recommendation to practice spaced reptition, which
        is the act of studying something, and slowly moving the time
        between studying out further and further.</p>

      <h3 id="what-are-three-new-things-you-have-learnt-about-yourself-and-your-ego-due-to-the-human-skills-learning">
        what
        are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
        ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>I have a growth mindset!</li>
        <li>My brain is capable of reforming it’s self through the
          concept of neuroplasticity</li>
        <li>That even with a growth mindset, I can still find myself
          frustrated, and moving to a non-growth mindset place, and
          that taking a break helps me return to the growth
          mindset.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="what-are-the-role-of-values-empathy-and-self-awareness-in-learning-and-programming">what
        are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
        learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>I think they help shape who you will be a programmer, but
        having self-awareness can help you understand your strengths
        and weaknesses, and how you work with others.</p>
      <h3 id="what-has-surprised-you-the-most-about-the-human-skills-learning">What
        has surprised you the most about the Human Skills
        learning?</h3>
      <p>I guess that I would find it as valuable as I have found
        it</p>
      <h3 id="what-were-the-most-challenging-aspects-of-the-human-skills-learning">What
        were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
        learning?</h3>
      <p>This one is hard, I don’t really think any of it was that
        challenging for me.</p>
      <h3
        id="why-do-you-think-we-a-programming-school-are-spending-so-much-time-focusing-on-human-skills-learning-in-a-web-development-bootcamp-course">
        Why
        do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
        time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
        Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>I reckon it has something to do with the type of people
        that are attracted to a course like this, but hopefully it
        has more to do with Dev Academy getting feedback from
        industry that this is one of the most important things they
        look for in candidates.</p>
      <h3
        id="does-the-time-you-spent-studing-human-skills-learning-here-feel-like-a-waste-of-timeshould-you-have-just-used-that-time-to-practise-programming-instead">
        Does
        the time you spent studing Human Skills learning here feel
        like a waste of time?Should you have just used that time to
        practise programming instead?</h3>
      <p>Definitely not for me. I found some much value from it. I
        think what I learned in the pre-course materials was the
        most valuable, and at times, the Human Skills work felt like
        box ticking, but that might be because I did the optional
        pre-course work.</p>
