        <hr />
        <p>A few core concepts of JavaScript and the DOM, that we learned in Sprint 3</p>
        <p>2025-01-23</p>
      </hgroup>

      <h2 id="how-the-sausage-is-made">How the sausage is made</h2>
      <p>Understanding how websites work can feel overwhelming so I’m going to
        use a simple analogy that does a pretty good job of explaining the
        different elements like HTML, CSS and how JavaScript interacts with
        them.</p>
      <p>First you have HTML which is like the structure of a house. It’s a
        static structure that has to be built in a certain way. You can
        customize it sure, but there are rules you have to follow like the
        “building code”. Then you have CSS which is like the paint you choose
        for the walls, and the furniture in the rooms, and the pictures you have
        on the wall. You can pick the paint color and you can arrange the
        furniture how you like. HTML and CSS are pretty much the foundation of
        any website you visit.</p>
      <p>Then comes JavaScript. Continuing with the House analogy, JavaScript
        is all of the interactivity in your home. When a light switch is
        flipped, the lights come on, when the faucet is opened water comes out,
        and when someone rings your doorbell a sound is made. JavaScript is the
        ability to manipulate the HTML and CSS. If you can imagine with me for a
        moment, if you just command your furniture to switch to a particular
        layout when you push a button, and have the walls change color at the
        same time, oh and have the radio turn on to your favorite
        playlist.That’s what JavaScript is able to do with HTML and CSS. It can
        completely transform them in an instance.</p>
      <h2 id="how-javascript-works">How JavaScript works</h2>
      <p>In JavaScript there are all kinds of concepts that make different
        things happen to a webpage. A couple of examples of these are control
        flow and loops.</p>
      <h3 id="control-flow">Control flow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>control flow is like putting a condition on what action to perform.
          You can think of this kind of like a traffic light. If the light is red
          stop, if yellow prepare to stop, otherwise keep driving. Here’s an
          example of what it looks like in JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>let kidsAge = 16

          if(kidsAge &lt; 18) {
          console.log(&quot;No entry to the bar&quot;)
          } else {
          console.log(&quot;let them into the bar&quot;)
          }</code></pre>
      <p>In this example the condition of <code>kidsAge &lt; 18</code>
        controls the flow of who gets into the bar, and who does not get into
        the bar.</p>
      <h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Loops are another example of a JavaScript concept, we can use to
          perform a task. Loops are used to perform repeated tasks. Imagine a loop
          like a teacher grading a stack of exams. There are set number of exams
          based on the number of students. The teacher needs to grade each test,
          then they need to assign a grade, and then they need to repeat the
          process with the next test. Here’s an example of what it might look like
          in JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>let numberOfTests = 5
          let testResults = [90, 50, 76, 88, 100]

          for (let i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTests; i++) {
          if (testResults[i] &gt;= 60) {
          console.log(&quot;Passed&quot;)
          } else {
          console.log(&quot;Not yet&quot;)
          }
          }</code></pre>
      <p>In this example we have five tests and we label that quantity of
        tests <code>numberOfTests</code>, Then we have a list of test results
        and we label that exact list of results <code>testResults</code> Now we
        want to auto-magically determine if they are passing scores or not
        passing scores, and to do the we used what is called a
        <code>for loop</code>. In a for loop there are three things needed, - an
        iterator <code>i = 0</code> which is essentially just a fancy way of
        saying the number of times the loop has repeated. - Next is the
        condition <code>i &lt; numberOfTests</code> that if no longer true the
        loop stops. When <code>i</code> is no longer less than
        <code>numberOfTests</code> stop looping. - And finally after we test the
        condition and it’s still true we want to increase the value of i by 1 or
        <code>i++</code> so the first time the loop runs i = 1, and the second
        time i = 2, and so on, until <code>i</code> is equal to
        <code>numberOfTests</code> and we stop looping.
      </p>
      <p>Then next 4 lines of code are what we want to do each time we loop.
        I’ll break it down in plain English and then I’ll explain how it works.
        In the first loop, we are going to check if the first score in the
        <code>testResults</code> list is above 60, and if it is we are going
        mark it down as passed. However if the test is less than 60 we are going
        to mark it down as not yet passed or not yet.
      </p>
      <p>Ok, so now I’ll try to explain what those 4 lines are doing. The
        first line is asking if the test result in position i &gt;= 60. Remember
        position <code>i</code> changes every time we loop because it is being increased by 1
        with <code>i++</code>. So on the first loop <code>i</code> is going to pull the first
        item off the list and test if it is greater than or equal to 60. If
        that’s true, it will log the test as passed. For the first loop
        <code>i</code> is 1 which means we are testing if the first item in the
        list named <code>testResults</code>. The first item is 90, so we are
        asking if 90 &gt;= 60, and it is so we will log the test as passed.
      </p>
      <p>Now the loop has finished its first cycle and will run again, and
        because we added 1 to the value of <code>i</code> we will check if the
        test result in the second spot of the list named
        <code>testResults</code> is greater than or equal to 60. The value in
        the second spot is 50, so we are asking is 50 &gt;= 60, and no, it is
        not greater than 60, so we say “if” it’s not &gt;= 60 what “else” can it
        be, “Not Yet”. So for the second loop the test result is logged as Not
        yet. Then it loops again, until <code>i</code> = 5 which is the number
        of tests (<code>numberOfTests</code>) we have to check, against the
        condition <code>i &lt; numberOfTests</code> which as a reminder we keep
        running the loop until this condition is no longer true.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-is-the-dom">What is the DOM?</h2>
      <p>The DOM is the interface for JavaScript to interact with HTML and
        CSS. It’s like writing a Microsoft word document. We have to push keys
        on a keyboard to get words to appear in the word document on the screen.
        Every key press triggers the action of a letter displaying in the word
        document. The DOM is the same way, ther are all of these actions the DOM
        is able to see that triggers a change in the HTML or CSS documents.</p>
      <h2 id="whats-the-difference-in-arrays-and-objects">What’s the
        difference in Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>An <strong>Array</strong> is a list of values, each spot in the list
        is a single value. Here’s some examples of single values:
        <code>["string value", 127, true]</code> These all represent a single
        piece of information stored in a list. <strong>Objects</strong> are like
        an Array because they are also lists, but in each spot of the list, can
        be multiple of what are called <code>key: value</code> pairs. For
        example the first item in the list is called <code>itemOne</code> and
        inside that item are details about that item like
        <code>size: large</code> or <code>cost: $20</code> these are the
        <code>key: value</code> pairs.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-are-functions-and-why-are-they-useful">What are functions
        and why are they useful</h2>
      <p><strong>Functions</strong> are reusable blocks of code design to do a
        specific thing. Well that right there is one reason they are useful,
        they can be reused. A function is basically a way of saying take these
        things I’m giving you, do this to them, and them give them back. It’s
        kind of like any service you could hire. We’ll use building a house as
        an example. You give your money to a builder, the builder turns your
        money into a house, and then gives you the house.</p>
      <pre><code>let costPerSqMeter = 10000

          function builderNeeds(moneyForHouse) {
          let houseSize = moneyForHouse / costPerSqMeter
          return houseSize
          }

          builderNeeds(200000)</code></pre>
      <p>In this example we are trying to see how big of a house we can afford, so we are giving our
        <code>moneyforHouse</code> number to the <code>builder</code> because they <code>Need</code> that number to
        determine the <code>houseSize</code> we can afford. The builder then takes that <code>moneyForHouse</code>
        number and divides it by their<code>costPerMeter</code> rate. They then return to the home buyers with the
        <code>houseSize</code> they can afford.

      <p>I’ve enjoyed writing this blog post, as it has helped solidify my
        understanding of these concepts. Thanks for reading.</p>
