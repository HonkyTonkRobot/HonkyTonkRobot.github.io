      <h2 id="a-time-i-was-blocked-on-a-simple-problem">A Time I
        Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
      <h3 id="what-was-the-problem">What Was the Problem?</h3>
      <p>In the ‘Gradebook Kata’ exercise, I struggled with
        problem 3 despite trying various approaches.</p>
      <h3 id="what-problem-solving-techniques-did-you-use">What
        Problem-Solving Techniques Did You Use?</h3>
      <p>I experimented with <code>for in</code> loops,
        <code>for</code> loops, and combinations of both,
        overcomplicating the solution. Ultimately, I realized the
        answer was simply using the <code>.forEach()</code> method,
        which I had learned previously, but with added value and
        index parameters.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-did-you-feel-throughout-the-process">How Did You
        Feel Throughout the Process?</h3>
      <p>I felt frustrated but persisted because I wanted to
        learn. I researched various techniques but now see that
        using pseudocode could have clarified my thinking.</p>
      <h3 id="what-did-you-learn">What Did You Learn?</h3>
      <p>I learned that overcoming challenging problems deepens my
        understanding and memory of techniques. Specifically, I
        discovered that the <code>.forEach()</code> method can
        utilize an array’s index similarly to a traditional for
        loop.</p>
      <h2 id="a-time-i-was-able-to-elegantly-solve-a-problem">A
        Time I Was Able to Elegantly Solve a Problem</h2>
      <h3 id="what-was-the-problem-1">What Was the Problem?</h3>
      <p>In the ‘flipflop Kata,’ I needed to determine if an array
        of numbers was divisible by 5, 3, or both.</p>
      <h3 id="what-problem-solving-techniques-did-you-use-1">What
        Problem-Solving Techniques Did You Use?</h3>
      <p>I primarily used pseudocode, recognizing that the
        solution would involve an if-else structure based on our
        previous work with conditionals.</p>
      <h3 id="how-did-you-feel-throughout-the-process-1">How Did
        You Feel Throughout the Process?</h3>
      <p>I felt confident and on the right track. Although it took
        several attempts, I was assured that persistence would lead
        to a solution.</p>
      <h3 id="what-did-you-learn-1">What Did You Learn?</h3>
      <p>I learned that in an if-else statement, I can assign the
        result to a variable and return it outside the statement.
        This approach, which I discovered through research, proved
        effective.</p>
      <h2 id="reflect-on-confidence-in-problem-solving-techniques">Reflect
        on Confidence in Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode: 7/10</li>
        <li>Trying Something: 7/10</li>
        <li>Rubber Ducky Method: 4/10</li>
        <li>Reading Error Messages: 6/10</li>
        <li>Googling: 8/10</li>
        <li>Asking Peers for Help: 7/10</li>
        <li>Asking Coaches for Help: 4/10</li>
        <li>Improving Process with Reflection: 10/10</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reflection is my strongest skill, helping me solidify and
        recall what I learn.</p>
      <h2 id="reflect-on-reluctance-to-ask-for-help">Reflect on
        Reluctance to Ask for Help</h2>
      <p>I hesitated to ask for help on the ‘Gradebook Kata’ after
        recently seeking assistance and feeling more stuck. I
        noticed that others weren’t asking for help as frequently,
        which made me feel isolated in my struggles. I messaged my
        facilitator but received no response, leading me to continue
        working on the problem alone until I eventually found a
        solution.</p>
      <p>This exercise was particularly challenging, and I felt
        even more hopeless with the next problem. I spent the entire
        4.5 hours allotted before giving up, realizing I should have
        used pseudocode. My reluctance to reach out stemmed from
        embarrassment, which is unusual for me.</p>
      <p>Next time, I will diligently apply each problem-solving
        technique and carefully review the provided information, as
        I found that some hints made a problem much easier to
        solve.</p>
