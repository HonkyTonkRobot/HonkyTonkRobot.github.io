        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Some stories about problem solving. Times it went well, and times when I was blocked.</p>
        <p>2024-01-29</p>

      <h2 id="a-time-i-was-blocked-on-a-simple-problem">A time I was blocked
        on a simple problem</h2>
      <h3 id="what-was-the-problem">What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>In the ‘Gradebook Kata’ exercise on problem 3, I tried several
        things.</p>
      <h3 id="what-problem-solving-techniques-did-you-use">what
        problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>I tried <code>for in</code> loops, <code>for</code> loops,
        <code>for in</code> loops with <code>for</code> loops inside of them,
        and <code>for</code> loops with an <code>if</code> statement inside it.
        All of these things were over thought attempts at solving the
        problem.
      </p>
      <p>What I finally realized is it was just the same
        <code>.forEach()</code> method that I learned in the step before, which
        seems obvious now. The only difference is this one built off of the last
        one by using the value, and index parameters of the
        <code>.forEach()</code> method.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-did-you-feel-throughout-the-process">how did you feel
        throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>I was frustrated, but I kept persisting, as I wanted to learn it. I
        tried many of the problem solving techniques we just learned. Mostly
        researching possible ways to do it. I realize now I should have tried
        using pseudocode as this might have clued my into what I was
        missing.</p>
      <h3 id="what-did-you-learn">what did you learn?</h3>
      <p>What I learned is that when I have these trying problems, when I
        finally find the solution I understand what I was learning much better,
        which I think helps with the memory of the technique.</p>
      <p>I learned specifically in this problem, that the
        <code>.forEach()</code> method has a built in way to use an array’s
        index to guide the loop similarly to how a for loop is typically
        setup.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-time-i-was-able-to-elegantly-solve-a-problem">A time I was
        able to elegantly solve a problem</h2>
      <h3 id="what-was-the-problem-1">What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>In the ‘flipflop Kata’ the problem was to determine if an array of
        numbers was divisible by 5, 3, or both 5 and 3.</p>
      <h3 id="what-problem-solving-techniques-did-you-use-1">what
        problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>In this one I mainly used the pseudocode problem solving technique. I
        think this made sense as the choice as an Intuitively know that this was
        going to be and if, else if, else statement, from our previous exercise
        about conditionals in sprint-3.</p>
      <h3 id="how-did-you-feel-throughout-the-process-1">how did you feel
        throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>I felt good as I knew I was on the right path, and even though it
        took a few attepts to getting working, I knew if I kept trying different
        versions of what I was doing that I’d get it.</p>
      <h3 id="what-did-you-learn-1">what did you learn?</h3>
      <p>I learned that in an if, else if statement that you can assign the
        result to a variable, and then outside of the statement but still in the
        function return the result. I think in my previous learnings the return
        was within the if statement but I might be mistaken. though when
        googling to help my figure out what I wasn’t doing correctly I saw
        someone else formating it this way, and I thought I’d give it a try, it
        worked.</p>
      <h2 id="reflect-on-how-confident-you-feel-using-each-of-these-problem-solving-techniquesprocesses">Reflect
        on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes</h2>

        <li>Improving your process with reflection - 10 out of 10</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reflection is proving to be my best skill as it helps me solidify the
        things I am learning, and tests my ability to recall them, and if I
        can’t it gives me a nudge to go and refresh my memory on what I
        learned.</p>

        id="reflect-on-a-time-you-were-reluctant-to-ask-for-help.-consider-what-made-you-reluctant-to-do-so.-what-might-you-try-differently-next-time">
        Reflect
        on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you
        reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
      <p>I was reluctant to ask for help on the ‘Gradebook Kata’ exercise, as
        I had just asked for help on the previous problem, and was even more
        stuck than the previous.</p>
      <p>Thinking about why I was reluctant to ask for help, was because no
        one else or seemed to be reaching out for help as frequently as I was. I
        started to feel I was alone in my struggles to solve these problems. In
        my embarrassment of needing help, I messaged my facilitator directly,
        but received no response, which I’m sure was just him not being
        available at the time I reached out. So I continued to try and solve the
        problem, and I eventually found the solution.</p>
      <p>This exercise was really kicking my ass, as the next problem I felt
        even more hopeless and finding the solution. I attempted the problem for
        the remainder of the 4.5 hours allotted for the exercise before giving
        up. I tried many of the problem-solving techniques, but realize now I
        should have tried pseudocoding. I’m really not sure why I didn’t
        try.</p>
      <p>I didn’t reach out to our facilitator this time around, or my
        classmates as I was feeling embarrassed which is out of character for
        me.</p>
      <p>I will work through each problem-solving technique more diligently
        next time around, and I will try and more meticulously comb through the
        information provided, as one problem became really easy to solve when I
        finally clocked what the hints were in the deBee exercise
        information.</p>
